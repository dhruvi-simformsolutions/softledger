App description:

This is a simple app that allows users to create an "Account" and then create a "Journal". Each journal stores an account and an amount.
The backend code is in ./backend
It is a node.js restana app(restana is almost identical to express.js)

The frontend code is a react app utilizing material ui.

The database schema is in the ./database folder

Credentials to the database can be found in ./backend/server/config/test.env.js

The database is postgres running as an RDS in AWS, it is publicly accessible.


Requirements:

1. Update the schema to add a new field "status" which can be "approved" or "draft"
2. When Journals are created the status should be set to draft
3. Update the UI Journals page to have a new button to approve each journal, one at a time
4. Backend will need to be updated to set journals as approved. Proper errors should be returned if the journal is not found, or if it is already approved.
5. Add ability to delete journals with draft status only. Proper error should be thrown for missing journals or approved journals).
6. Add unit tests using mocha/chai/sinon to ./backend/server/api/__TEST__/journals.unit.test.js for the new functionality.
